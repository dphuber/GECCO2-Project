# [Gradient with Eddy Covariance CO2 (GECCO2) Project](https://github.com/dphuber/GECCO2-Project)
GECCO2 uses co-located and high frequency measures of soil and ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) flux to improve our mechanistic understanding of soil and ecosystem carbon cycling in cold-desert ecosystems. The project was developed by Dr. David Huber and Dr. Mark Seyfried. Model development and coding by [Dr. David Huber](https://github.com/dphuber) and [Dr. Ken Aho](https://github.com/kenaho1). The intended use of GECCO2v1.1 is calculation of CO2 flux and production in soil profiles. Later releases will include predictive models for soil respiration using current and antecedent soil environmental factors. This project was developed at as part of the [Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory](https://criticalzone.org/reynolds/research/).
