# Gradient with Eddy Covariance CO2 (GECCO2) Project
GECCO2 uses co-located and high frequency measures of soil and ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) flux to improve our mechanistic understanding of soil and ecosystem carbon cycling in cold-desert ecosystems. The project was developed by Dr. David Huber and Dr. Mark Seyfried. Model development and coding by Dr. David Huber @dphuber and Dr. Ken Aho @ahoken1. The intended use of GECCO2v1.1 is calculation of CO2 flux and production in soil profiles.
